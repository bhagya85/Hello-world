# Hello-world
Salesforce proect

I am Bhagya. I am a highly motivated person and a keen learner. I am a thoughtful person, provide value by innovation and proactive at work. I try to excel in any given job, adaptability is one of my strengths. I have completed my undergrad in computer science in 2007, then started full time job at a reputed company called Tata Consulting Services immediately in the year 2008. Worked there for about 3 years and then resigned due to relocation after wedding. Being a mom for 2 kids put me closer to family for a few years away from work. Being inspired by continuous learning, took a handful of masters level computer science courses at Portland State University and also did Salesforce admin certification during this period. I am now seeking for a good inspiring job that benefits both the business and myself.
